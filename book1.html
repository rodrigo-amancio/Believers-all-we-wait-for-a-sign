          <br><span class="small-text">But matter is not substance. In the Cartesian tradition, substance corresponds to the non-extended God separated from the physical world of nature. The split between the mind and the body originated from the separation of the cosmos from matter, of the transcendent God—the power of the soul–mind—from nature—the power of the physical body. The body originates in God as God corresponds to an intensive and extensive substance. Matter is able to manifest itself through the ceaseless mutation of bodies and things in nature.</span></br>

They are absolute and they are eternal, as they are omnipotent and omniscient; they affect physical states, but are not affected by them; they do not change with time and they automatically exert their force anywhere in the universe, not needing the systems to inform them of their own existence.</span></br>
